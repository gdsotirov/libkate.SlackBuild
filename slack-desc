libkate: LibKate (a karaoke and text codec for embedding in ogg)
libkate:
libkate: Kate is a codec for karaoke and text encapsulation for Ogg.  Most
libkate: of the time, this would be multiplexed with audio/video to carry
libkate: subtitles, song lyrics (with or without karaoke data), etc, but
libkate: doesn't have to be.  A possible use of a lone Kate stream would be
libkate: an e-book.  Moreover, the motion feature gives Kate a powerful
libkate: means to describe arbitrary curves, so hand drawing of shapes can
libkate: be achieved. This was originally meant for karaoke use, but can be
libkate: used for any purpose.  Motions can be attached to various semantics,
libkate: like position, color, etc, so scrolling or fading text can be
libkate: defined.
